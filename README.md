As the sole dedicated analyst, I recently spearheaded the analytical aspect of a critical project that involved developing a comprehensive data-driven Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy for our sass product offering. This involved not just identifying and optimizing key performance indicators (KPIs), but also designing and building insightful dashboards and reports. These dashboards would track the entire customer lifecycle journey, from initial brand awareness all the way through to customer retention. In this post, I’ll delve into the business challenge we faced, the approach I took to tackle it, the implementation details, and the positive outcomes we achieved.

Business Problem:
Our product offering had recently undergone a significant pivot, and we needed to understand how our customers were interacting with our brand across various touch points. We lacked a unified view of our customer journey, which made it challenging to:

Optimize our marketing efforts and allocate budget effectively
Improve conversion rates and reduce drop-offs across funnels
Align our sales, marketing, and product teams around a common understanding of our customer needs
Problem Solution Approach:
To address this challenge, I built a data model that captures the customer lifecycle journey. I collaborated with cross-functional teams across marketing, sales, product, product marketing, and content to ensure that our model accurately reflected our business processes and the various touch points. Our approach involved:

Defining key performance indicators (KPIs) for each stage of the customer journey
Identifying data sources and integrating them into a unified dataset
Building a data models and queries
Designing and developing dashboards and reports to visualize the data and insights
Implementation:
To protect sensitive information, I won’t be sharing the actual website traffic data/queries used. However, to illustrate the process, i’ll demonstrate the methodology using a Python script that generates realistic, data and metrics, allowing us to simulate the dashboards and reports.
